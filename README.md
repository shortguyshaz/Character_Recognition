# Character_Recognition

I created a neural network to recognize handwritten characters (letters from 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z') with Keras using the TensorFlow backend.

This is the dataset used to train the model: https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format

It contains 372450 images of handwritten alphabets in 28 x 2, all in a .csv file.

This is the model I used for reference to create the neural network: https://data-flair.training/blogs/handwritten-character-recognition-neural-network/
