# Character_Recognition

I created a neural network to recognize handwritten characters (letters from 'A' to 'Z' and 'a' to 'z') with Keras using the TensorFlow backend.

After 10 minutes of training the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 98% which can be increased with larger training sets.

This is the dataset used to train the model: https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format

It contains 372450 images of handwritten alphabets in 28 x 2, all in a .csv file.

This is the model I used for reference to create the neural network: https://data-flair.training/blogs/handwritten-character-recognition-neural-network/
